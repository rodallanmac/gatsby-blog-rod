***Origin and translation of the word from the Arabian into various languages—Views of many writers***

THE history of the word coffee involves several phonetic difficulties. The European languages got the
name of the beverage about 1600 from the original Arabic ***qahwah***, not directly, but through its
Turkish form, ***kahveh***. This was the name, not of the plant, but the beverage made from its infusion, being
originally one of the names employed for wine in Arabic.

Sir James Murray, in the *New English Dictionary*, says that some have conjectured that the word is a
foreign, perhaps African, word disguised, and have thought it connected with the name Kaffa, a town in Shoa,
southwest Abyssinia, reputed native place of the coffee plant, but that of this there is no evidence, and the
name ***qahwah*** is not given to the berry or plant, which is called ***bunn***, the native name in Shoa being būn.

Contributing to a symposium on the etymology of the word coffee in *Notes and Queries*, 1909, James
Platt, Jr., said:

The Turkish form might have been written kahvé, as its final ***h*** was never sounded at any time. Sir
James Murray draws attention to the existence of two European types, one like the French café, Italian
caffè, the other like the English coffee, Dutch koffie. He explains the vowel o in the second series as
apparently representing au, from Turkish ahv. This seems unsupported by evidence, and the v is already
represented by the ff, so on Sir James's assumption coffee must stand for kahv-ve, which is unlikely. The
change from a to o, in my opinion, is better accounted for as an imperfect appreciation. The exact sound
of ă in Arabic and other Oriental languages is that of the English short u, as in "cuff." This sound, so easy
to us, is a great stumbling-block to other nations. I judge that Dutch koffie and kindred forms are
imperfect attempts at the notation of a vowel which the writers could not grasp. It is clear that the French
type is more correct. The Germans have corrected their koffee, which they may have got from the Dutch,
into kaffee. The Scandinavian languages have adopted the French form. Many must wonder how the hv of
the original so persistently becomes ff in the European equivalents. Sir James Murray makes no attempt to
solve this problem.

Virendranath Chattopádhyáya, who also contributed to the *Notes and Queries* symposium, argued that the
*hw* of the Arabic qahwah becomes sometimes *ff* and sometimes only *f* or *v* in European translations because
some languages, such as English, have strong syllabic accents (stresses), while others, as French, have none.
Again, he points out that the surd aspirate h is heard in some languages, but is hardly audible in others. Most
Europeans tend to leave it out altogether.

Col. W.F. Prideaux, another contributor, argued that the European languages got one form of the word
coffee directly from the Arabic qahwah, and quoted from Hobson-Jobson in support of this:

*Chaoua* in 1598, *Cahoa* in 1610, Cahue in 1615; while Sir Thomas Herbert (1638) expressly states
that "they drink (in Persia) ... above all the rest, *Coho* or *Copha*: by Turk and Arab called *Caphe* and
*Cahua*." Here the Persian, Turkish, and Arabic pronunciations are clearly differentiated.

Col. Prideaux then calls, as a witness to the Anglo-Arabic pronunciation, one whose evidence was not
available when the *New English Dictionary* and Hobson-Jobson articles were written. This is John Jourdain, a
Dorsetshire seaman, whose *Diary* was printed by the Hakluyt Society in 1905. On May 28, 1609, he records
that "in the afternoone wee departed out of Hatch (Al-Hauta, the capital of the Lahej district near Aden), and
travelled untill three in the morninge, and then wee rested in the plaine fields untill three the next daie, neere
unto a cohoo howse in the desert." On June 5 the party, traveling from Hippa (Ibb), "laye in the mountaynes,
our camells being wearie, and our selves little better. This mountain is called Nasmarde (Nakīl Sumāra),
where all the cohoo grows." Farther on was "a little village, where there is sold cohoo and fruite. The seeds of
this cohoo is a greate marchandize, for it is carried to grand Cairo and all other places of Turkey, and to the
Indias." Prideaux, however, mentions that another sailor, William Revett, in his journal (1609) says, referring
to Mocha, that "Shaomer Shadli (Shaikh 'Ali bin 'Omar esh-Shādil) was the fyrst inventour for drynking of
coffe, and therefor had in esteemation." This rather looks to Prideaux as if on the coast of Arabia, and in the
mercantile towns, the Persian pronunciation was in vogue; whilst in the interior, where Jourdain traveled, the
Englishman reproduced the Arabic.

Mr. Chattopádhyáya, discussing Col. Prideaux's views as expressed above, said:
Col. Prideaux may doubt "if the worthy mariner, in entering the word in his log, was influenced by
the abstruse principles of phonetics enunciated" by me, but he will admit that the change from kahvah to
coffee is a phonetic change, and must be due to the operation of some phonetic principle. The average
man, when he endeavours to write a foreign word in his own tongue, is handicapped considerably by his
inherited and acquired phonetic capacity. And, in fact, if we take the quotations made in "Hobson-
Jobson," and classify the various forms of the word coffee according to the nationality of the writer, we
obtain very interesting results.
Let us take Englishmen and Dutchmen first. In Danvers's Letters (1611) we have both "coho pots"
and "coffao pots"; Sir T. Roe (1615) and Terry (1616) have cohu; Sir T. Herbert (1638) has coho and
copha; Evelyn (1637), coffee; Fryer (1673) coho; Ovington (1690), coffee; and Valentijn (1726), coffi.
And from the two examples given by Col. Prideaux, we see that Jourdain (1609) has cohoo, and Revett
(1609) has coffe.
To the above should be added the following by English writers, given in Foster's English Factories in
India (1618–21, 1622–23, 1624–29): cowha (1619), cowhe, couha (1621), coffa (1628).
Let us now see what foreigners (chiefly French and Italian) write. The earliest European mention is by
Rauwolf, who knew it in Aleppo in 1573. He has the form chaube. Prospero Alpini (1580) has caova;
Paludanus (1598) chaoua; Pyrard de Laval (1610) cahoa; P. Della Valle (1615) cahue; Jac. Bontius (1631) caveah; 
and the Journal d'Antoine Galland (1673) cave. That is, Englishmen use forms of a certain distinct
type, viz., cohu, coho, coffao, coffe, copha, coffee, which differ from the more correct transliteration of
foreigners.

In 1610 the Portuguese Jew, Pedro Teixeira (in the Hakluyt Society's edition of his Travels) used the word
*kavàh*.

The inferences from these transitional forms seem to be: 
1. The word found its way into the languages of Europe both from the Turkish and from the Arabic. 
2. The English forms (which have strong stress on the first syllable) have ŏ instead of ă, and f instead of h. 
3. The foreign forms are unstressed and have no h. The original v or w (or labialized u) is retained or changed into f.

It may be stated, accordingly, that the chief reason for the existence of two distinct types of spelling is the
omission of h in unstressed languages, and the conversion of h into f under strong stress in stressed languages.
Such conversion often takes place in Turkish; for example, silah dar in Persian (which is a highly stressed
language) becomes zilif dar in Turkish. In the languages of India, on the other hand, in spite of the fact that
the aspirate is usually very clearly sounded, the word qăhvăh is pronounced kaiva by the less educated classes,
owing to the syllables being equally stressed.

Now for the French viewpoint. Jardin[3] opines that, as regards the etymology of the word coffee, scholars
are not agreed and perhaps never will be. Dufour[4] says the word is derived from caouhe, a name given by
the Turks to the beverage prepared from the seed. Chevalier d'Arvieux, French consul at Alet, Savary, and
Trevoux, in his dictionary, think that coffee comes from the Arabic, but from the word cahoueh or quaweh,
meaning to give vigor or strength, because, says d'Arvieux, its most general effect is to fortify and strengthen.
Tavernier combats this opinion. Moseley attributes the origin of the word coffee to Kaffa. Sylvestre de Sacy,
in his Chréstomathie Arabe, published in 1806, thinks that the word kahwa, synonymous with makli, roasted
in a stove, might very well be the etymology of the word coffee. D'Alembert in his encyclopedic dictionary,
writes the word caffé. Jardin concludes that whatever there may be in these various etymologies, it remains a
fact that the word coffee comes from an Arabian word, whether it be kahua, kahoueh, kaffa or kahwa, and that
the peoples who have adopted the drink have all modified the Arabian word to suit their pronunciation. 

This is shown by giving the word as written in various modern languages:
French, café; Breton, kafe; German, kaffee (coffee tree, kaffeebaum); Dutch, koffie (coffee tree,
koffieboonen); Danish, kaffe; Finnish, kahvi; Hungarian, kavé; Bohemian, kava; Polish, kawa; Roumanian,
cafea; Croatian, kafa; Servian, kava; Russian, kophe; Swedish, kaffe; Spanish, café; Basque, kaffia; Italian,
caffè; Portuguese, café; Latin (scientific), coffea; Turkish, kahué; Greek, kaféo; Arabic, qahwah (coffee berry,
bun); Persian, qéhvé (coffee berry, bun[5]); Annamite, ca-phé; Cambodian, kafé; Dukni[6], bunbund[7];
Teluyan[8], kapri-vittulu; Tamil[9], kapi-kottai or kopi; Canareze[10], kapi-bija; Chinese, kia-fey, teoutsé;
Japanese, kéhi; Malayan, kawa, koppi; Abyssinian, bonn[11]; Foulak, legal café[12]; Sousou, houri caff[13];
Marquesan, kapi; Chinook[14], kaufee; Volapuk, kaf; Esperanto, kafva.
