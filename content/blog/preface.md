**SEVENTEEN years ago (1905) the author of this work made his first trip abroad to gather material for a book on coffee. Subsequently he spent a year in travel among the coffee-producing countries.** 

After the initial surveys, correspondents were appointed to make researches in the principal European libraries and museums;
and this phase of the work continued until April, 1922. Simultaneous researches were conducted in American
libraries and historical museums up to the time of the return of the final proofs to the printer in June, 1922.
Ten years ago the sorting and classification of the material was begun. The actual writing of the
manuscript has extended over four years. 


Among the unique features of the book are the Coffee Thesaurus; the Coffee Chronology, containing 492
dates of historical importance; the Complete Reference Table of the Principal Kinds of Coffee Grown in the
World; and the Coffee Bibliography, containing 1,380 references.
  
The most authoritative works on this subject have been Robinson's The Early History of Coffee Houses in
England, published in London in 1893; and Jardin's Le Café, published in Paris in 1895. The author wishes to
acknowledge his indebtedness to both for inspiration and guidance. Other works, Arabian, French, English,
German, and Italian, dealing with particular phases of the subject, have been laid under contribution; and
where this has been done, credit is given by footnote reference. In all cases where it has been possible to do
so, however, statements of historical facts have been verified by independent research. Not a few items have
required months of tracing to confirm or to disprove.  

There has been no serious American work on coffee since Hewitt's Coffee: Its History, Cultivation and
Uses, published in 1872; and Thurber's Coffee from Plantation to Cup, published in 1881. Both of these are
now out of print, as is also Walsh's Coffee: Its History, Classification and Description, published in 1893.
The chapters on The Chemistry of Coffee and The Pharmacology of Coffee have been prepared under the
author's direction by Charles W. Trigg, industrial fellow of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research.
