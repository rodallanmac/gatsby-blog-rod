***Origin and translation of the word from the Arabian into various languages—Views of many writers***

THE history of the word coffee involves several phonetic difficulties. The European languages got the
name of the beverage about 1600 from the original Arabic ***qahwah***, not directly, but through its
Turkish form, ***kahveh***. This was the name, not of the plant, but the beverage made from its infusion, being
originally one of the names employed for wine in Arabic.

Sir James Murray, in the *New English Dictionary*, says that some have conjectured that the word is a
foreign, perhaps African, word disguised, and have thought it connected with the name Kaffa, a town in Shoa,
southwest Abyssinia, reputed native place of the coffee plant, but that of this there is no evidence, and the
name ***qahwah*** is not given to the berry or plant, which is called ***bunn***, the native name in Shoa being būn.

Contributing to a symposium on the etymology of the word coffee in *Notes and Queries*, 1909, James
Platt, Jr., said:

The Turkish form might have been written kahvé, as its final ***h*** was never sounded at any time. Sir
James Murray draws attention to the existence of two European types, one like the French café, Italian
caffè, the other like the English coffee, Dutch koffie. He explains the vowel o in the second series as
apparently representing au, from Turkish ahv. This seems unsupported by evidence, and the v is already
represented by the ff, so on Sir James's assumption coffee must stand for kahv-ve, which is unlikely. The
change from a to o, in my opinion, is better accounted for as an imperfect appreciation. The exact sound
of ă in Arabic and other Oriental languages is that of the English short u, as in "cuff." This sound, so easy
to us, is a great stumbling-block to other nations. I judge that Dutch koffie and kindred forms are
imperfect attempts at the notation of a vowel which the writers could not grasp. It is clear that the French
type is more correct. The Germans have corrected their koffee, which they may have got from the Dutch,
into kaffee. The Scandinavian languages have adopted the French form. Many must wonder how the hv of
the original so persistently becomes ff in the European equivalents. Sir James Murray makes no attempt to
solve this problem.

Virendranath Chattopádhyáya, who also contributed to the *Notes and Queries* symposium, argued that the
*hw* of the Arabic qahwah becomes sometimes *ff* and sometimes only *f* or *v* in European translations because
some languages, such as English, have strong syllabic accents (stresses), while others, as French, have none.
Again, he points out that the surd aspirate h is heard in some languages, but is hardly audible in others. Most
Europeans tend to leave it out altogether.

Col. W.F. Prideaux, another contributor, argued that the European languages got one form of the word
coffee directly from the Arabic qahwah, and quoted from Hobson-Jobson in support of this:

*Chaoua* in 1598, *Cahoa* in 1610, Cahue in 1615; while Sir Thomas Herbert (1638) expressly states
that "they drink (in Persia) ... above all the rest, *Coho* or *Copha*: by Turk and Arab called *Caphe* and
*Cahua*." Here the Persian, Turkish, and Arabic pronunciations are clearly differentiated.

Col. Prideaux then calls, as a witness to the Anglo-Arabic pronunciation, one whose evidence was not
available when the *New English Dictionary* and Hobson-Jobson articles were written. This is John Jourdain, a
Dorsetshire seaman, whose *Diary* was printed by the Hakluyt Society in 1905. On May 28, 1609, he records
that "in the afternoone wee departed out of Hatch (Al-Hauta, the capital of the Lahej district near Aden), and
travelled untill three in the morninge, and then wee rested in the plaine fields untill three the next daie, neere
unto a cohoo howse in the desert." On June 5 the party, traveling from Hippa (Ibb), "laye in the mountaynes,
our camells being wearie, and our selves little better. This mountain is called Nasmarde (Nakīl Sumāra),
where all the cohoo grows." Farther on was "a little village, where there is sold cohoo and fruite. The seeds of
this cohoo is a greate marchandize, for it is carried to grand Cairo and all other places of Turkey, and to the
Indias." Prideaux, however, mentions that another sailor, William Revett, in his journal (1609) says, referring
to Mocha, that "Shaomer Shadli (Shaikh 'Ali bin 'Omar esh-Shādil) was the fyrst inventour for drynking of
coffe, and therefor had in esteemation." This rather looks to Prideaux as if on the coast of Arabia, and in the
mercantile towns, the Persian pronunciation was in vogue; whilst in the interior, where Jourdain traveled, the
Englishman reproduced the Arabic.
